Far Downs Pass
This pass runs through a valley between the downs. The ground is heavily
littered with loose rocks, with tough, yellowish grass scattered among them.
There is little sound to be heard here, beyond any that might be made by
travellers. Steep hillsides rise up to the east and south, blocking movement in
those directions, while to the west the hills rise more gradually.
A mountain mule is standing here, ridden by you.

An almost overgrown trail seems to continue into the hills.
The hills is open.
