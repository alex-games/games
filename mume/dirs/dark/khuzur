# Khuzur: Khuzur is an orc mob on the edge on the misty mountains. In his camp you can expect to find rope, snowshoes, some food, scale sleeves, and a pan. Also, in a corpse nearby you can find leather armor, a skin, quiver & arrows and some other odds & ends. To find, look for:

    * Camp on the Hills: open door, go south and east. To get the corpse from here go all north from the camp, then head west until A Mountain View. Go south and "take all corpse", but be careful! There's an aggressive vulture there that will kill you if you linger long.
    * Misty mountains: Look for bushy plains. In general, head west if possible, and then head south if you can't go west. If neither of these are possible, head east until you can got south again. These directions should take you along the western edge of the misty mountains zones. You should eventually reach a room called bushy plains. Be careful! South of this is a room named Hills with Black trees. In this room, hidden archers shoot at you and you die quickly. Avoid this room by opening the hidden exit 'thornbushes', and going west along the secret path past bushes. You should be able to find khuzur near there.
