Ooc: In this place, you can expect to find some decent mobs to kill at level 14ish (orc torturer, grizzled orc, merchant orc, watersnake, etc) as well as a source of water, food, and sometimes random weapons or armor too. It is also relatively safe, though it is raided by pukes occasionally. Also, watch out for the warg pit below the orc torturer: its noflee!

    * From camp on the hills: 2n 2e open bushes n e open thornbushes 4e 4s 2e s e 2s 2e s e s e n open looserocks n call open e
    * From redhorn pass: Follow the pass to approximately its midpoint. Around there is a room with exits east and south. "open looserocks" and step north. Then just call open and walk in. 

Good places to get experience:
