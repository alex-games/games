Eregion: This zone, and the surrounding zones are some of the best ones to hang out as a bn. Puke sightings are fairly rare, and the terrain is open with lots of rivers, so it is pretty easy to escape if you are attacked. There are plenty of monsters for levels 1-10 there and also some for higher levels as well. Watch out for wandering oxs and boars as well as Dunlending foresters and warriors which are aggressive to you.
