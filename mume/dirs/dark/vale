Broad Plains
Expansive fields of yellow and deep blue iris join the endless grasses of the
plains. A stand of barren trees and bushes grows tightly bound together by
invasive flowering vines, and provides some comfort from the elements. These
vines are blanketed with sprays of delicate pale pink buds which contribute a
sweet, intoxicating perfume throughout these plains.
