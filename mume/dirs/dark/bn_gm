The guild masters wander around arda and are difficult to find. However, it is not impossible. Look below for information on how to find the bn guildmasters.

Priest:

           :
   X ^Z^O  :
 ~*^^^^^^::~
:*~      ::A

The priest gm (black-robed man) hangs out on the path to Angmar.

Sorcerer:

           :
   ^ ^Z^O  :
 ~*^^^XXX::~
:*~      ::A

One of the sorcerer places is around noc-ish. This one is the harder one to find because he wanders all around and sometimes far from the path. The easiest way to find him is to have someone 'locate life' him.

The other sorcerer load spot is in the Green hills south of abr.

Thief:

The thief loads in one of two places. The first is off of abr (ancient broken road). Look for the rocky trail (its on the east side of the road on the other side of the musty forest). At the south end of the rocky trail is a room called border of an odd forest. Go east from there up a slanting path. He should be on that path.

Look for the forest past the sloping plains to find the other place.
